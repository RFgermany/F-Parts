# F-Parts
No idea where you put the part you need right now again? F-Parts is a part inventory system for whatever you need. Use it instead of relying on the chaos in your head or using uncomfortable spreadsheet software! You can not only organize your parts but also attach datasheets, info notes and images!

I use it mainly for my electronic parts, but you can really use it for anything you can imagine. The program is made in a way that you don’t even need to use it, because it creates a Human friendly tree folder structure and stores your parts inside of it. You are free to create whatever part categories you want. You can also create any number of subcategories that will allow you to keep precise records of all your parts. 
Adding inherent files to your part is as easy as clicking a button or simply dropping it in the part folder. Put a Picture with the name “icon.xxx” (xxx can be any common picture type like .jpg|.png|.gif|...) and it will be displayed as an icon of the category or your part. I included an example tree that will be loaded by default in your “My Documents” folder, with can be changed later by changing the folder path.
I will soon make a video tutorial that should explain everything.

## Consider a Donation!
It was a lot of work to program everything and I would be happy if you consider sending me a couple bugs via PayPal. Any amount makes me happy:
